# 2020 Solutions

These solutions require a couple libraries to run, more specifically
shared-code and link.

You can compile them by running "make build" in this folder, and that should create shared-code.o, link.o and linkutil.o.

You can also compile each solution with the same command as long as you are in their respective folder.
